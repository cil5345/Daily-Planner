# My Scheduler


## Intro
Schedulers are an essential part of any appointment based buisness. A good scheduler will help the front desk staff see what the current time is, dynamic color patterns for past times, current time, and future times, and save written information on the page. This will allow for quick and easy reading, especially when appointments are hectic

## My Scheduler
My planner is for a very small business that does appointments by blocks of hours. It is created using the javascript framework Jquery. The center of the header has the current time date and year via moment.js. The color of my blocks change dynamically depending on the time of day. If the appointment is past the current time, the block is indicated red, if it is the present hour, the box is a neutral white, and if it is a future appointment, then the block will be green. This ensures the user can quickly get information with just a glance of the scheduler.

## Trouble
My planner seemed to be great except for the localStorage. My save button saved my text input in the local storage, however I could not get it to stay on the page.

## Conclusion 
The scheduler overall was intermediate. The hardest part was getting the information to display with localStorage. The scheduler made me utilize moment.js, for loops, localStorage, and Jquery. If I had to change anything it would be the dynamic color changes. The red and green are very aggresive and hurts the user's eyes. This is problematic because most front-desk employees see the screen all day. I would make the dynamic changes a little more subtle, maybe a grey color with some opacity to it.
